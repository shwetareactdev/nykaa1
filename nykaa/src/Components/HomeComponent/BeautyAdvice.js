        <h2>Top Beauty Tips and Health Advice</h2>
        <p className="advice-paragraph">
          Achieving glowing skin and maintaining a healthy beauty routine is all about balance. Here are some essential beauty and wellness tips to help you feel confident and radiant.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Hydrate Your Skin from the Inside Out</h3>
        <p className="advice-paragraph">
          Drinking plenty of water daily is key to keeping your skin hydrated and healthy. Aim for at least 8 glasses a day and include hydrating foods like cucumbers, watermelon, and oranges in your diet.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Protect Your Skin with Sunscreen</h3>
        <p className="advice-paragraph">
          UV rays can cause premature aging, dark spots, and wrinkles. Always use sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher, even on cloudy days. Reapply every two hours for the best protection.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Follow a Simple, Yet Effective Skincare Routine</h3>
        <p className="advice-paragraph">
          A basic routine includes cleansing, toning, moisturizing, and applying sunscreen in the morning. At night, make sure to remove makeup, cleanse your skin, and apply a nourishing night cream or serum.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Eat a Skin-Boosting Diet</h3>
        <p className="advice-paragraph">
          Beauty starts from within! A diet rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals can enhance your skin’s glow. Include leafy greens, nuts, and fatty fish like salmon in your meals.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Get Your Beauty Sleep</h3>
        <p className="advice-paragraph">
          Your skin repairs itself while you sleep, so aim for 7-9 hours of quality rest each night. Lack of sleep can lead to dull skin, dark circles, and premature aging.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Exercise Regularly for a Natural Glow</h3>
        <p className="advice-paragraph">
          Sweating helps to remove toxins and increase blood circulation, leading to a healthier complexion. Even simple activities like yoga, jogging, or dancing can improve your skin’s glow.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Manage Stress to Prevent Breakouts</h3>
        <p className="advice-paragraph">
          Stress can trigger acne, eczema, and premature aging. Practice meditation, deep breathing, or engage in hobbies that help you relax and unwind.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Clean Your Makeup Brushes Weekly</h3>
        <p className="advice-paragraph">
          Dirty makeup brushes harbor bacteria and oil, which can lead to breakouts and skin infections. Wash them every week with gentle shampoo or a brush cleanser.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Exfoliate for Soft and Smooth Skin</h3>
        <p className="advice-paragraph">
          Exfoliation removes dead skin cells and helps your skincare products absorb better. Use a gentle scrub or chemical exfoliant 2-3 times a week for a fresh, glowing look.
        </p>

        <h3>10. Moisturize, Even if You Have Oily Skin</h3>
        <p className="advice-paragraph">
          Skipping moisturizer can make your skin produce even more oil! Use a lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturizer to keep your skin balanced and hydrated.
        </p>

        <h3>11. Choose the Right Makeup Products</h3>
        <p className="advice-paragraph">
          Always check the ingredients before buying makeup. Look for non-toxic, skin-friendly products, and avoid harsh chemicals that can damage your skin in the long run.
        </p>

        <h3>12. Pamper Your Lips</h3>
        <p className="advice-paragraph">
          Dry and chapped lips can be a sign of dehydration. Use a lip scrub once a week and keep your lips moisturized with a hydrating lip balm.
        </p>

        <h3>13. Don't Forget Your Neck and Hands</h3>
        <p className="advice-paragraph">
          Your neck and hands show signs of aging just as much as your face. Always apply sunscreen and moisturizer to these areas to keep them youthful and soft.
        </p>

        <h3>14. Try Natural Remedies</h3>
        <p className="advice-paragraph">
          Sometimes, simple home remedies work wonders. Try honey masks for hydration, green tea bags for dark circles, and aloe vera for soothing irritated skin.
        </p>

        <h3>15. Be Confident in Your Natural Beauty</h3>
        <p className="advice-paragraph">
          No matter what beauty routine you follow, confidence is key! Embrace your unique features, and remember that true beauty comes from within.
